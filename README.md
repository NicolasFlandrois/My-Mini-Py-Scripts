# My-Mini-Py-Scripts
Mini python Scripts

In this repository I'll stack tiny scripts, command lines automation, small programs, practices, and exercices that are not part of a bigger projects,  or not big enough to have it's own project repository.

----------------------------
## TOOLS:

- **ask_integer.py**:

    create a fonction to verify if input number is integer and within range.

## TINY PROJECTS:

+ **autogitcommitandpush.py**:

## Mini projects that moved to become a project of its own.

Those projects moved to their own repositories:

+ **Stardate Project**: 
    
    - Generate (star trek) Stardate according to current time. Changing reference date.
    - Convert a date for input gregorian date (ISO-8601), to a stardate.
    - Translate a stardate input to a Gregorian date (ISO-8601).
    - This project has now an [independant GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolasFlandrois/stardate.git), and is no longer followed in this My-Mini-Python-Script Repo.
    
    *status*: Finished - v2

+ **Mayan Calendar Project** :

    - Generate of Mayan Long Count Calendar according to current time. Changing reference date.
    - Convert an input date (from gregorian ISO-8601 calendar) to Long Count.
    - Translate a Long Count Input, into a Gregorian date (ISO-8601 calendar).
    - Same 2 generator, convertor, translator, for Tzolkin and Ha'ab Mayan Calendar. Which is more difficult, as they are cycles, and don't refer to a year.
    - This project has now an [independant GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolasFlandrois/maya_date.git), and is no longer followed in this My-Mini-Python-Script Repo.
    
    *status*: Finished - v1

+ **Name Data Base Generator** (python + SQL):

    - The python generator will create random name association from lists of male names, female names and Family names, to generate a sql data base. Further more this kind of data base generator, can generate massive amount of data (names pairs). Such data base can be use to test software and scripts needing data. Such generator can be used for other objects than names.

    - Each entry containing:
        + ID SQL Key (autogenerated by SQL)
        + Family name (randomly paired with first name)
        + First name (randomly paired with family name)
        + Gender (M/F depending on first name randomly assigned)
        + Birth date (Random)
        + Socialsecurity number (According to gender + Year of birth + Month of birth + Randomly assigned department number in range or within a list + 8 random numbers) cf: [wiki page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9ro_de_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_sociale_en_France#ancrage_C)
